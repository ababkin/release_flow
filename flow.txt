What state are we in?
- if we are in the middle of a release there will be a release branch and release candidate tag(s) 
  without a corresponding release tag where the version represents the latest release or candidate

Example (this does NOT mean we're in the middle of a release, it means we've abandoned one):
1.2.1-rc1
1.2.1-rc2
1.2.1-rc3
1.2.1

1.1.0-rc1


Moving through the states:

is there a bugs branch of the form release/<latest_release_candidate/bugs/* (we are in process of fixing a bug on a release candidate) ?
  yes -> goto Step 3
  no -> 
    can we find a RC newer than last release ?
      no ->
        create a new release candidate
        push tags
      yes ->
        do we want to abandon RC ?
          yes ->
            remove all RC tags for the corresponding upcoming release (e.g. 1.2.1-rc1, 1.2.1-rc2, etc), 
            push tags
            goto Step 1
          no -> goto Step 2





Step 1

give <release_name> as the argument

- takes the latest green ci tag
- creates a branch named <release_name>
- tags the head of this branch as release candidate
- let's you know what it did
- remove the release branch
- exit

Step 2

- asks whether release candidate is good

Yes:

- create a release tag for the head of the release branch
- push the tag
- delete the release branch
- let's you know what it did

No:

- branch off of the latest release candidate tag
- branch off the temporary branch to create a bug fix: prompt user for <bug_name> release/1.2.1-rc1/bugs/<bug_name>
- tell user to fix the bug
- exit



Step 3

- once user has fixed bug, proceed to next step:
  - merge bug fix branch into temporary branch --no-ff
  - merge bug fix branch into integration --no-ff
  - delete bug fix branch
  - delete bug fix branch on origin
  - tag new release candidate
  - delete temporary branch
- let's you know what it did

~% release-flow
- determine step
- tell user what step we're in
- tell them how to abort
